   NB. increment: increments the scalar elements of a numeric array
   increment =: >:
   increment mat2_3
1 2 3
4 5 6

   NB. Eventually increment will always
   NB. operate on scalars, regardless 
   NB. of the rank specified
   increment"1 mat2_3
1 2 3
4 5 6

   NB. showTasks: illustrates the tasks 
   NB. that would be created with 
   NB. the parallel rank operator
   showTasks =: agreement (< @)

   NB. tasks created by regular
   NB. use of increment would be
   NB. one for every scalar (6)
   (increment showTasks) mat2_3

   NB. tasks created by applying
   NB. increment on rank 1
