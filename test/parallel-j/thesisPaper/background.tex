\section{Function Rank}
This section provides background information to help the reader understand 
what function rank is and how it can help programmers exploit data parallelism.

\subsection{History and Definition}
\textit{Function rank} was first developed and described by Kenneth Iverson in a series of research reports written at IBM\cite{rapl}\cite{opandfunc}. 
In one report, Iverson described it as 
``the most important notion needed to provide a simple and systematic basis for the uniform treatment of all `mixed' or non-scalar functions''\cite{rapl}. % TODO footnote of next comment
Since that time, the idea of function rank has matured and found its way into many dialects of APL, including J.

J's model of function rank is slightly different from the model originally presented by Iverson\cite{rankanduni}\cite{jvocab}. 
In J, the rank of a function \texttt{f} is a vector \texttt{v} of three values that represents the data rank of \texttt{f}'s expected arguments.
Since in J functions take either one or two arguments, 
the first value of \texttt{v} represents the rank of \texttt{f}'s argument in \textit{f's} single argument case 
(in J referred to as the \textit{monadic} case);
the second and third values in \texttt{v} represent the ranks of \texttt{f}'s arguments in \textit{f's} two-argument (\textit{dyadic}) case.
If \texttt{f} has no rank expectations on one of its arguments, the corresponding entry for that argument in \texttt{v} is infinity (spelled in J \texttt{\_});
if one of \texttt{f}'s arguments is a scalar, 
the corresponding value is 0 
(in J, scalars are collections of rank 0). %TODO make footnote

For example, most arithmetic functions (such as addition) 
operate on scalar values, and thus have the function rank \texttt{0 0 0}.
These arithmetic functions, and all other functions that operate on scalar values, 
must be extended to operate on collections of rank $n \ge 1$ 
(fortunately, in J these extensions are done automatically).
On the other hand, some functions (like a sort function) take a whole collection as their argument, 
and thus might have the function rank \texttt{\_ \_ \_}.

\subsection{Shape Agreement}
In the cases where a J function \texttt{f} operates on arguments whose ranks match \texttt{f}'s rank, 
\texttt{f} behaves much like a function in programming languages without formalized function rank (c.f. Fig~\ref{fig:j-ig-fr}).
When \texttt{f}'s arguments do not match its function rank, 
J can sometimes automatically extend \texttt{f} to match its arguments.
For example, if \texttt{x} is a scalar and \texttt{c} is a collection of numbers, 
J will automatically extend addition so that \texttt{x} is added to every element of \texttt{c} no matter the rank or shape of \texttt{c} 
(c.f. Fig~\ref{fig:j-def-fr}).

In general, J can automatically extend addition (and all other functions on scalars) over two regular collections \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}
if the shape of one collection \textit{prefixes} the other.
Hui called this prefix the frame for the two collections 
and called what remains of the shape vectors of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} 
after dropping the prefix their respective \texttt{cells}\cite{rankanduni}. 
In this paper we will also say that when a suitable prefix can be found, 
the shapes of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} agree under the function (e.g., addition).

The examples in Figs~\ref{fig:j-def-fr}, \ref{fig:agree1}, \ref{fig:agree2} illustrate that 
a scalar, a vector of 2 elements, and another 2 by 3 matrix will all agree with \texttt{mat2\_3} under addition, 
since the shapes of the scalar (the empty shape), the vector, and the other matrix would prefix the shape of \texttt{mat2\_3}; 
any collection of rank $n \ge 2$ whose shape begins with $2$ $3$ will also agree with 
\texttt{mat2\_3} under addition, since the shape of \texttt{mat2\_3} prefixes its shape.
In the last example in Figure~\ref{fig:agree3}, 
every scalar of \texttt{mat2\_3} is added to both of the scalars in each vector of \texttt{arr2\_3\_2}. 
Another way to say this is that J made an implicit \textit{map} on the scalar elements of \texttt{mat2\_3}, 
expanding each into a vector of 2 copies of the original scalar.
J can do this because, with a \textit{frame} of \texttt{2 3}, \texttt{mat2\_3}'s \textit{cells} are scalars and 
\texttt{arr2\_3\_2}'s \textit{cells} are vectors of two scalars.

\subsection{Rank Operator}
So far, we are still unable to add a vector \texttt{vec3} of 3 scalars to \texttt{mat2\_3}, 
since the shapes \texttt{3} and \texttt{2 3} have no suitable prefix.

\begin{quote}
\begin{singlespacing}
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
   show vec3 =: i. 3
0 1 2
  vec3 + mat2_3
|length error
|   vec3    +mat2_3
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
\end{singlespacing}
\end{quote}

\noindent However, it should be possible to add \texttt{vec3} to each of the vectors of \texttt{mat2\_3} 
since each of these vectors have the same length.
To allow the programmer to extend functions in ways other than the default from prefix agreement, 
J also includes a \texttt{rank operator} (spelled with double quotes: \texttt{"}).
The rank operator is a higher order function that takes as its first argument a function (not higher-ordered) % TODO footnote for taking function?
and as its second argument a vector of 1, 2, or 3 numeric values, 
and returns a function that performs the same operation as the argument function but on the specified data rank\cite{rankanduni}.

For example, the following command, 

\begin{quote}
\begin{singlespacing}
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
   vec3 +"1 mat2_3
0 2 4
3 5 7
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
\end{singlespacing}
\end{quote}

\noindent is read ``add the rank 1 items of \texttt{vec3} to the rank 1 items of \texttt{mat2\_3}.''
In terms of \textit{frames}, \textit{cells}, and implicit \textit{maps}, 
the frames of the rank 1 items in \texttt{mat2\_3} and \texttt{vec3} are \texttt{2} and the empty frame, respectively, 
and they share a common cell size \texttt{3}.
Because the frame at rank 1 of \texttt{vec3} prefixes the rank 1 frame of \texttt{mat2\_3} (the empty frame prefixes every frame), 
the shapes now agree, and there is an implicit map on the single vector element of \texttt{vec3} expanding to a matrix of two vectors.

\subsection{The Application of a Function with Rank on its Arguments}
\label{fridp}
The following is a high level description of how a function \texttt{f} with rank \texttt{r} 
is applied to its arguments \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}\cite{rankanduni}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate the cell shape at rank \texttt{r} of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} 
		by taking the \texttt{r} smallest dimensions of the shape vector of each.
		E.g., the cell shape of \texttt{mat2\_3} at rank 1 is 3, since each vector contains 3 items.
	\item Calculate the frame shape at rank \texttt{r} of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} 
		by removing from the shape vector of each their respective cell shapes.
		E.g, at rank 1, the frame shape of \texttt{mat2\_3} is $2$,
		the frame shape of \texttt{arr2\_3\_2} is $2$ $3$, 
		and the frame shape of \texttt{vec3} is an empty frame.
	\item If the frame shape of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} do not agree, then return with an error.
		Otherwise, extend the argument with the smaller frame shape via an implicit map on its cells at rank \texttt{r}.
		If the frame shape of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are the same, do nothing.
	\item \label{dataparstep}Apply \texttt{f} to every cell at rank \texttt{r} of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
		If \texttt{f} is a user defined function \texttt{u} with function rank \texttt{ru} given with the rank operator,
		(i.e., \texttt{f =: u ("ru)})
		repeat this process with each of the cells of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}, \texttt{u}, and \texttt{ru}
	\item Reassemble the result cells of the previous step using the agreed frame shape.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inherent Data Parallelism}

While many of these steps have some exploitable concurrency, 
step \ref{dataparstep} has the most potential for performance increases through parallelism.
It is inherently data parallel because 
\texttt{f} operates on each pair of cells in \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} independently.
For large computations, it is also the most computationally intensive step
since it recurses on cells that can themselves be large regular collections.

Finally, because all functions in J have these steps in common, 
they can also all be parallelized in the library, rather than by the user.
Therefore, programs that use a parallelized library with function rank 
can exploit any inherent data parallelism in their problem automatically, 
provided the problem can be expressed in terms of function rank.

\section{Other Approaches}
\subsection{Regular Parallel Arrays in Haskel}
\label{repa}
In 2010, Keller et al. published a paper 
describing a Haskell library they had created called \textit{Repa}\cite{dph}
that implements and parallelizes regular arrays.
There is much to commend about their work, including ``that it (1) is purely
functional, (2) supports reuse through shape polymorphism, (3)
avoids unnecessary intermediate structures rather than relying on
subsequent loop fusion, and (4) supports transparent parallelization,''
and that it is a library for a functional language with relatively wide use. 
Two features of \textit{Repa} impact current and future work on Parallel-J: 
\textit{index functions} and the static capture of a collection's shape information.

\textit{Repa} achieves good performance on a family of operations known as \textit{index transformations} 
(such as transposing or shifting an array) 
by formalizing the notion of an \textit{index function}.
An \textit{index transformation} is an operation on a regular collection that 
conceptually changes how items in a collection are accessed (indexed). 
For example, using a C-style notation, 
the index transformation of transposing a matrix would be
\texttt{transpose2D(matrix)[i][j] $\Leftrightarrow$ matrix[j][i]}, for all integers $i,j$. 
With index functions, programmers can implement index transformations as 
a change to the way a collection is indexed, 
rather than as a copy of elements to another location in memory.
Parallel-J currently lacks index functions, 
but a future Scala regular collections library could easily support them.

Impressively, \textit{Repa} also statically captures some of the effects functions have on the shapes of their arguments.
For example, in their paper the type signature of \textit{sum} shows that, given a numeric array of rank $n$, 
\textit{sum} returns an array of rank $n-1$ with the same shape as the argument array 
except without the rightmost (smallest) dimension\cite{dph}.
Another way to state this is \textit{sum} takes an arbitrary regular array of rank $n \ge 1$ 
and sums that array's vectors, 
returning an array whose shape is the shape of the argument array but with the smallest dimension dropped off.
Consequently, passing \textit{sum} a rank 0 array would be a compile-time error.
In general, this library ``enables [the user] to track the rank of each array in its type,
guaranteeing the absence of rank-related runtime errors''\cite{dph}.

\textit{Repa}'s static capture of the rank of a function's arguments is equivalent to J's notion of function rank.
\textit{Repa} implements an array's rank as a list inhabited by the type \texttt{Int} % TODO footnote
and analyzes its structure through Haskell's pattern-matching facilities and some language extensions.
\textit{Repa} also has a significant advantage over J in that, lacking a static type system, 
the effects functions in J have on the rank of their arguments cannot be known statically.
However, unlike J, Repa appears to lack a rank operator.
Instead, functions must be extended manually to arrays of higher rank. 
While the manual extensions in \textit{Repa} 
(such as in functions like \textit{replicate} and \textit{backpermute}) 
are safer from error than nested \textit{maps} or \textit{for loops}
due to \textit{Repa}'s type safety and to reducing some of the boilerplate code,  
because it does not express these extensions as higher-ordered functions, 
programmers using \textit{Repa} must still work at a conceptually lower-level of abstraction 
and write more boilerplate code than if they used J's rank operator.

For example, while in J \textit{sum} (spelled \texttt{+/}) 
automatically sums the rank $n-1$ items of a rank $n$ array, 
in \textit{Repa} \textit{sum} by default operates only on the scalars (rank 0 items) of the vectors of a collection. 
To extend the existing \textit{sum} function in \textit{Repa} to any array of rank $n > 1$, 
programmers must write a new function that manually extends \textit{sum} to each dimension they desire\cite{dph}.
In contrast, getting the same behavior as \textit{Repa}'s \textit{sum} function in J requires no manual extension;
it is written \texttt{+/ " 1}, which (when translated in English) 
reads rather intuitively as ``apply sum to the vector elements of its argument.''

Finally, although both J and Repa support some notion of function rank, 
conceptually it is easier to understand, for example, 
that \texttt{f (" 3)} means ``apply f on the rank 3 items'', than it is to understand \textit{Repa}'s equivalent, 
\texttt{(sh.:Int.:Int.:Int)} as it would appear in the function declaration below: 

\[\texttt{f :: (Shape sh, Elt e) => Array (sh :. Int :. Int :. Int) e -> Array sh e} \]

\noindent Haskell's static type system causes \textit{Repa}'s greater verbosity; 
it also allows \textit{Repa} to capture the effects operations have on data rank at compile time. 
However, capturing the rank of \texttt{f}'s argument both statically and numerically (and thus, in a more convenient fashion)
requires a type system more sophisticated than Haskell's or even many of its language extensions. % TODO cite
J, in contrast, is dynamically typed, and while this means J does not catch errors before runtime, 
its functions also do not need to statically document their effects on data, simplifying the way programmers write and use code.

\subsection{SA-C, Boost MultiArray}
While \textit{Repa} seems to be the best of the alternative solutions available, 
due to being already parallelized, capturing the effects functions have on the rank of their data, 
and reducing boilerplate code, 
it is appropriate to mention other influential work in the subject of data parallelism on regular collections.
Our analysis is mostly in agreement with the developers of \textit{Repa}\cite{dph}.

Single-Assignment C (\textit{SA-C}) is a functional, C-like language 
that has many of the same advantages as \textit{Repa}\cite{dph}\cite{sac}.
Unfortunately, this also means that it has the same limitations, most notably the lack of a rank operator.
Additionally, unlike \textit{Repa} and our own research (but like J), 
it is a special purpose array programming language and 
not an extension to an existing, general purpose programming with a broad user base and 
with access to large and well developed libraries.

The C++ library Boost.MultiArray, in contrast, is a library for a general purpose and widely used programming language\cite{boost}.
However, its ability to analyze and operate on the structure of regular collections is limited compared to SA-C or \textit{Repa}.
Furthermore, it does not benefit from a naturally parallel implementation, 
its arrays are operated on in a conceptually lower (imperative) level, 
and it also does not have an equivalent to the rank operator.
