borrowed.

\section{Examples of math}
\label{section:example-math}

This section contains some math.
First, here's a set of equations.

\begin{eqnarray*}
y_p	&	=	&	\frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2+a^2}}, \\
y_p^2	&	=	&	\frac{y^2}{y^2+a^2}, \\
y_p^2	&	=	&	\frac{y^2+a^2-a^2}{y^2+a^2}, \\
y_p^2	&	=	&	1-\frac{a^2}{y^2+a^2}, \\
y_p^2-1	&	=	&	-\frac{a^2}{y^2+a^2}, \\
1-y_p^2	&	=	&	\frac{a^2}{y^2+a^2}.
\end{eqnarray*}

Now here's a numbered equation.
