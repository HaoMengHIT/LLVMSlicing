\noindent
Function rank has important applications in parallel computing.
In particular, certain formalizations of function rank can help exploit potential concurrency, 
because these formalizations allow the programmer to express 
safely, easily, and in an automatically data parallel fashion  
both the application of a function to subcollections of a regularly shaped multidimensional collection and 
the extension of an existing function to similar problems in higher dimensions.

This paper illustrates the importance of function rank 
by discussing solutions to three parallel problems that both do and do not use formalized function rank. 
Each problem represents a different parallel design pattern, 
so that the discussion extends to entire classes of parallel probelms. 
Additionally, this paper includes both a set of proposals for a parallel implementation of J, 
which is an array-oriented, functional programming language with function rank, 
and a prototype implementation of a parallel regular collections library using function rank in Scala. 
Also given are the performance results for solutions to each of the problems 
both in Scala using the prototype library and in C with OpenMP, for comparison.
This work is, however, intended only as a proof of concept.
